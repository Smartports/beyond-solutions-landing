# Frontend Patterns

## UI Framework
- [index.html](mdc:index.html) uses TailwindCSS for styling via CDN
- Alpine.js for reactive UI components
- AOS (Animate On Scroll) for scroll animations

## Component Structure
- Alpine.js components are defined with `x-data` attribute
- Navigation component defined as `x-data="nav"`
- Language selector as a standalone component
- Theme toggle with light/dark mode support

## Theme Management
- Dark mode support via Tailwind's `dark:` variant
- User preference stored in localStorage
- System preference detection with `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Toggle button for manual user preference

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Mobile menu toggle for smaller screens
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Media queries for fine-tuning specific screen ranges

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for non-critical images
- Preloading critical images
- Reduced animation for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Debounced event listeners for scroll/resize events
- Efficient Alpine.js reactivity
