# Phase 6 - Finance Module $watch Error Fix

## Issue Description

The error occurred when navigating to the costs/finance phase:

```
finance.js:45 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: this.$watch is not a function
```

## Root Cause

The error trace was misleading. The actual issue was not in `finance.js` but in how the scenario buttons were handling state changes in `calculator-gamified.html`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Scenario Buttons

Changed from direct property assignment to method calls:

```html
<!-- Before -->
@click="scenario = 'optimistic'"

<!-- After -->
@click="changeScenario('optimistic')"
```

This ensures proper state management and triggers the finance module updates correctly.

### 2. Added Change Handlers for Radios

Added `@change` handlers to construction system and material level radios:

```html
<!-- Construction System -->
<input type="radio" @change="updateConstructionSystem()" ... />

<!-- Material Level -->
<input type="radio" @change="updateMaterialLevel()" ... />
```

This ensures the finance module recalculates when these values change.

## Technical Details

### Why the Error Occurred

1. Alpine.js methods like `$watch` are only available within Alpine components
2. The finance module is a standalone JavaScript module, not an Alpine component
3. The error trace was showing the wrong line number due to async execution

### Key Learnings

1. Always use methods for state changes that affect external modules
2. Don't rely on x-model alone for complex state management
3. Error stack traces in async operations can be misleading

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to the calculator-gamified.html page
2. Progress to Phase 3 (Costs)
3. Click on different scenarios - no errors should appear
4. Change construction systems and material levels - calculations should update
