## 🚀 Action Plan (Next 2 Hours)

### Step 1: Start Server and Initial Test (15 min)

```bash

./start-server.sh

# Method 2: Manual start
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Test URLs:**

⚡ PreloadOptimizer initialized
✅ Phase 6 features initialized successfully!
```

### Step 3: Test Keyboard Navigation (30 min)

**Tab Navigation:**

1. Press `Tab` key repeatedly
2. Should see skip links appear at top
3. Should be able to navigate through all elements

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- `Alt + M` → Skip to main content
- `Alt + C` → Skip to calculator
- `Alt + H` → Show keyboard help dialog

**If Not Working:**

- Check if accessibility.js loaded in Network tab
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Verify Alpine.js is not conflicting

### Step 4: Test Mobile Features (30 min)

**Desktop Mobile Simulation:**

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toggle button (phone icon)
3. Select "iPhone 12 Pro"
4. Refresh the page

**What to Check:**

- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] All text readable without zooming

### Step 5: Run Lighthouse Audit (25 min)

**Steps:**

1. In Chrome DevTools, go to "Lighthouse" tab
2. Select "Mobile" device
3. Check all categories
4. Click "Analyze page load"

**Record Baseline Scores:**

- Performance: \_\_\_/100
- Accessibility: \_\_\_/100
- Best Practices: \_\_\_/100
- SEO: \_\_\_/100

**Focus Areas:**

- Accessibility should be >85 (target: 95+)
- Performance should be >80 (target: 90+)

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Based on Testing

### If Skip Links Don't Appear:

```javascript
// Run in browser console:
console.log(window.accessibilityManager);
window.accessibilityManager.setupSkipLinks();
```

### If Mobile Controls Missing:

```javascript
// Run in browser console:
console.log(window.mobileOptimizer.isMobile);
console.log(window.mobileOptimizer.isTouch);
```
